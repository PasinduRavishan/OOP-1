## üß© Class Overview

| Class | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `Book` | Represents a book with id, title, author, and ISBN |
| `User` | Represents a user of the library |
| `LibraryCatalogue` | Stores a list of Book objects and displays them |

The `User` can borrow a book (logged through console messages), and the `LibraryCatalogue` holds all the books.
